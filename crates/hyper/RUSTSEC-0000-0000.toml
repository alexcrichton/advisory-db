title = "HTTPS MitM vulnerability due to lack of hostname verification"
description = """
All versions of Hyper prior to 0.9.4 did not perform hostname verification when
making HTTPS requests.

This allows an attacker to perform MitM attacks by preventing any valid
CA-issued certificate, even if there's a hostname mismatch.

The problem was addressed by leveraging rust-openssl's built-in support for
hostname verification.
